# TradingView indicators

### 'Crypto Cradle' trading strategy

My trading success has been largely due to self-discipline and strategies taught by [@TraderCobb](https://twitter.com/TraderCobb) 

His '[Crypto Cradle](https://tinyurl.com/cobb-courses-2019)' and '[Bitcoin Breakout](https://tinyurl.com/cobb-courses-2019)' courses set the foundation for consistent trading success. 

Below are scripts I've written to assist in identifying and automating (alerting) potential trades.

## [Crypto Cradle](https://www.tradingview.com/script/NqzFpfex-Crypto-Cradle-trigger/)

This indicator highlights candles that meet many of the criteria required to take a short/long position. More detail is on the indicator description page.

## [Crypto Cradle Trade Assistant](https://www.tradingview.com/script/cNHOAIDP-Crypto-Cradle-Trade-Assistant/)

This is an assistant indicator to help you work out your entry price, trade amount, stop price, 1:1 scale-out price, and potential profit based on using the [Crypto Cradle](https://tinyurl.com/cobb-courses-2019) strategy

## More indicators

## [Linear Levels](https://www.tradingview.com/script/6zrmtVer-Linear-Levels/)

This indicator allows you to place linear levels on your chart to help plan your trades.

## [Explosive Potential](https://www.tradingview.com/script/rwBArbXJ-Explosive-Potential/)

This indicator looks at times where MACD is within a specified range (very close to 0 values) and price action is very constrained (under 1-5% depending on the coin). Historically price has made a strong move after these conditions.
